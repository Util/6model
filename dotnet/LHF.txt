"Low Hanging Fruit"
===================

This file contains tasks that should be relatively small and easy. If
you want to start hacking on the 6model implementation on .Net, this
is a great way to jump in! Questions? Try catching jnthn on #perl6
on freenode.

String comparative operators
----------------------------
DIFFICULTY: Easy-Intermediate
SKILLS: NQP, C#
DETAILS:
At the moment, there is no support for the operators lt, le, gt and
ge. Two things are needed to make this happen. First, you'll need to
make some new entries in runtime/Runtime/Ops as a way to actually
provide the low-level comparative logic. See equal_strings for
example. Then you'll need to add some entries to NQPSetting.pm (it's
outside of the dotnet tree, in /common/NQP). Finally, see about
getting the relevant tests running from the nqp-rx test suite.
